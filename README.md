## General Information
- Multiple linear regression is performed on the dataset.
- The project is done as part of coursework in the AI ML 
- We are trying to find the number of rentals issued from the company based on numerous independent values such as temperature, weather, humidity, holiday, etc. 
- The Boombikes bike rental dataset is being used.

## Conclusions

1) The R-squared value of the train set is 82.8% whereas the test set has a value of 80% which suggests that our model explains 80% of the variance and can conclude that it is a good model. 

2) The model's mean squared error is almost 0 on both the training and testing datasets which suggests that the variance is accurately predicted on the test set. 

3) We can conclude that the bike demands for the BoomBikes is company is dependent on the temperature and whether it is a workingday or not. Additionally more rentals seem to be demanded on the winters as compared to the summer and spring. We had observed that the months of September and October had higher use of rentals. In terms of days the maximum focus was on days like Wed, Thurs and Sat and more on holidays. 

4) Rentals were more in 2019 than 2018 which suggests that the deamand for the bike rental idea is picking up steadily
